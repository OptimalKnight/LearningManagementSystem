# Academic Course Management Portal

A basic application built using the flutter framework to keep track of and manage the academic courses in an institution. The web application supports role based logins with three main roles, namely,
- Students
- Instructors
- Faculty Advisors 

The application allows instructors (and faculty advisors) to offer courses of their choice. The students are able to see the list of courses which are available for them to enrol in. If interested, a student can request to enrol in a course which is first passed on to the course intructor, and after approval, to the faculty advisor of the student's program. The application allows the student to keep track of all his enrollment requests and also allows him/her to deregister for a course at any point. 

## How To Use

The application is deployed and hosted on firebase. \
